This project will focus on two human uses and their relationships to the MPA network: commercial and commercial passenger fishing vessel (CPFV) fisheries. The goal of the project is to assess the baseline socioeconomic conditions of commercial and CPFV fisheries throughout the state of California. Our team will design an approach to monitor socioeconomic conditions related to fishing to inform long-term MPA monitoring. Results of this study will guide the 10-year management review of California’s MPA network.

The socioeconomic status of California state fisheries is affected by the complex exchange between regulatory, environmental, and socioeconomic factors. MPAs are one of the many influences that could affect spatial fishing patterns and the economic health of California fisheries. Given this complexity, this project aims to assess commercial and CPFV fisheries across the state using temporal, spatial, and place-based approaches. Combined, these approaches will illustrate economic and spatial changes over time and provide insights on how place-based factors, including MPAs, have played a role in driving observed and experienced socioeconomic changes.

### Temporal  

We will analyze historical economic trends (e.g., participation rates, landings, revenue) in commercial and CPFV fisheries from 1992 to 2020 and use this time-series data to conduct pre- and post-MPA assessments to describe the current economic status of fisheries.

### Spatial

We will integrate regional level spatial data sets over 12 years to develop a statewide understanding of pre- and post-MPA fishing patterns. From this, we will evaluate how spatial fishing patterns have changed since MPA implementation.

### Place-based

In Spring and Summer 2020, we will engage with the commercial and CPFV fishing communities in an on-the-ground focus group tour throughout 24 port complexes in California. To assist this effort, we are developing a ‘Port Community Well-being Assessment Tool’ (i.e., a questionnaire) that will be used to gather quantitative information about the health and well-being of California fisheries in the context of MPAs. Questions from the Tool will guide focus group discussions, which will be used to gain a snapshot of the socioeconomic conditions of fisheries in California. The focus groups will provide information about fishermen’s perceptions of MPAs and the ways fishermen have been affected by the MPAs since implementation.
